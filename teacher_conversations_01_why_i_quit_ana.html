                <div class="story-author">by Sarah Mitchell, Former High School English Teacher</div>
                
                <p>I handed in my resignation on a Tuesday in November. My principal stared at me like I'd lost my mind. Maybe I had. It wasn't one big thing – it was everything. The parent who screamed at me because her son failed, even though he hadn't turned in work for three months. The administration adding another meeting when I was already drowning. The new curriculum with no training, no resources, no time. But mostly? It was realizing I couldn't remember the last time I'd actually enjoyed teaching. I used to love walking into my classroom. Now I was just surviving, counting days until Friday. The breaking point was a faculty meeting where we celebrated test scores improving by 2%. Two percent. And everyone clapped. I sat there thinking: "Is THIS what we're celebrating? Not the student who learned to love reading – just numbers?" That afternoon, I started looking for other jobs. People ask, "How could you quit mid-year?" But I can't give students my best when I'm running on empty. My last day is December 15th. I don't have another job lined up. But I have something I haven't had in years: hope.</p>

                <p>People ask why I haven't quit. The money's terrible, the parents are exhausting, and the administration treats us like we're the problem. But last week, a former student messaged me. She's a doctor now. She said, "Remember when you told me I was smart enough for medical school? I didn't believe you. But you believed it enough for both of us." I barely remember that conversation. It was probably just office hours, nothing special. But to her? It changed everything. That's why I stay. Because you never know which small moment saves someone. You never know which student needs exactly what you said that day. So yeah, I'm tired. Yeah, I'm underpaid. But I'm not leaving. Not yet. Because maybe tomorrow I'll say the thing that changes someone's life. And I'd hate to miss that.</p>
