            <div class="story-box">
                <p>In 2010, Princeton researchers Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton studied 450,000 Americans. Their finding shocked the world:</p>
                <p><strong>Below $75,000 per year, more money significantly increases happiness. Above $75,000, additional income has almost no effect on day-to-day emotional well-being.</strong></p>
                <p>In 2023, new research updated this number to about <strong>$95,000</strong> (adjusted for inflation), but the principle remains the same: <em>There's a threshold. After that, you're trading time for money that won't actually make you happier.</em></p>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h4>📊 James - The Corporate Lawyer ($280,000/year)</h4>
                <p>James graduated from Harvard Law School at 25. By 32, he was a partner at a prestigious firm in New York, making $280,000 per year. He had the apartment, the car, the watch.</p>
                <p>"I remember sitting in my office at 11 PM on a Friday night, eating takeout sushi at my desk—for the third night that week—and thinking: <em>This is it? This is what I worked so hard for?</em>"</p>
                <p>"I hadn't seen my nephew in six months. My parents kept asking when I'd visit. My college friends stopped inviting me to things because I always canceled."</p>
                <p>At 34, James quit. He now works as in-house counsel for a small tech company, makes $95,000, works 40 hours a week, and says: <strong>"I've never been happier. And I have enough money."</strong></p>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h4>🏠 Maria - The Lifestyle Creep ($120,000/year)</h4>
                <p>Maria started her career making $45,000. She lived in a small apartment with roommates, took public transportation, cooked at home. She was happy.</p>
                <p>Ten years later, she's making $120,000. She lives alone in a nice apartment ($2,800/month rent), owns a car ($650/month payment), eats out regularly, buys nice clothes, goes on expensive vacations.</p>
                <p>"On paper, I should be so much happier than I was at 25. I'm making almost three times as much money! But somehow, I feel more stressed. My expenses grew with my salary. I'm still living paycheck to paycheck—I just have nicer stuff."</p>
                <p>"The worst part? <em>I can't go back.</em> I'm so used to this lifestyle now. The idea of moving back into a shared apartment, taking the bus again, cooking every meal... it feels impossible. I'm trapped by my own success."</p>

                <p>Tom and Lisa were both software engineers in San Francisco, each making over $150,000. They lived in an expensive apartment, drove nice cars, and had all the tech toys.</p>
                <p>At 35, they quit their jobs, moved to Portugal, and now live on $70,000 per year from investments and remote consulting work.</p>
                <p>"People think we're crazy. They ask: 'Don't you miss the money?' And honestly? <strong>Not for a second.</strong>"</p>
                <p>"We work maybe 20 hours a week. We have lunch together every day. We've made incredible friends. We travel all the time. We're learning Portuguese. We actually have <em>lives</em>."</p>
                <p>"The biggest lie we believed was that we needed to 'maximize our earning years' while we were young. We were miserable. Now we have less money and infinitely more happiness."</p>

            <h3>The Paradoxes of Money & Happiness</h3>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Paradox #1: The Hedonic Treadmill</strong><br>
                You get a raise. You're excited for a week. Then it becomes normal. You want the next raise. Humans adapt to new circumstances quickly—both good and bad.
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Paradox #2: Lifestyle Creep</strong><br>
                The more you earn, the more you spend. Many people making $200,000 feel just as financially stressed as people making $60,000 because their expenses grew with their income.
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Paradox #3: Time vs. Money</strong><br>
                To earn more money, you often need to work more hours. But happiness research shows that free time, relationships, and experiences matter more than money (once your basic needs are met).
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Paradox #4: Relative vs. Absolute Wealth</strong><br>
                Making $80,000 feels great... until you discover your colleague makes $95,000 for the same job. Humans compare. Your absolute wealth matters less than your relative wealth.
            </div>

            <div class="stat-box">
                <div class="number">$10-20K</div>
                <div class="description">Studies show that spending $10-20K on time-saving services (cleaner, food delivery, etc.) increases happiness more than spending $10-20K on luxury goods</div>
            </div>

            <h3>The Hard Questions</h3>

            <div class="reflection-prompt">
                <h4>Think About Your Own Life:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>How much money do YOU actually need to be comfortable?</li>
                    <li>What are you currently sacrificing to earn money? (Time? Health? Relationships?)</li>
                    <li>If you could work less and earn less, would you? Why or why not?</li>
                    <li>Are your expenses matching your values, or did they just grow with your income?</li>
                    <li>When was the last time you felt truly satisfied with what you have?</li>
