                <p><strong>At 22, his dad said:</strong> "Study something practical. Get a stable job first. You can pursue your passion later, but you need financial security."</p>
                <p><strong>Alex's response:</strong> "That's such old-person thinking. I'm going to follow my dreams! I'm studying art and I'll figure it out!"</p>
                <p><strong>At 28:</strong> Alex was a struggling artist, living paycheck to paycheck, $40,000 in debt from art school, working retail jobs he hated to pay rent.</p>
                <p><strong>At 32:</strong> "My dad was completely right. I wish I'd gotten a practical degree, built financial stability, THEN pursued art as a serious hobby or side business. Now I'm 32, broke, and starting over. I hate admitting this, but he knew what he was talking about."</p>

            <h3>Why We Didn't Listen</h3>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>1. Experience Can't Be Taught</strong><br>
                You can tell someone a stove is hot, but they don't really understand until they touch it. Some lessons require personal experience.<br><br>

                <strong>2. We Think We're Different</strong><br>
                "Sure, that happened to OTHER people, but it won't happen to ME. I'm special." Spoiler: You're not that special.<br><br>

                <strong>3. Generational Gaps Feel Huge at 20, Small at 40</strong><br>
                At 20, your parents seem ancient and out of touch. At 40, you realize 20 years isn't that long and people don't change as much as you thought.<br><br>

                <strong>4. Pride and Rebellion</strong><br>
                Part of growing up is rejecting parental advice to establish independence. It's developmentally normal. It's also often stupid in hindsight.

            <h3>The Core Message</h3>

            <div class="wisdom-box">
                <p>Growing up means realizing your parents weren't trying to control you—they were trying to protect you from pain they'd already experienced.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The humbling part? You now give the same advice they gave you. And young people don't listen to you either.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>The cycle continues.</strong> But at least now you understand it.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Your Complete Journey: All 72 Expressions</h3>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>You've learned sophisticated expressions for discussing:</strong><br>
                • Job loss, automation, and career anxiety (Lesson 1)<br>
                • Ambition, achievement, failure, and life lessons (Lesson 2)<br>
                • Difficult decisions, sunk costs, and toxic situations (Lesson 3)<br>
                • Adult friendships, drifting apart, and letting go (Lesson 4)<br>
                • Money, happiness, lifestyle, and priorities (Lesson 5)<br>
                • Generational wisdom, growing up, and maturity (Lesson 6)
            </div>

            <h3>What Made This Course Different</h3>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h4>✅ Real Content, Not Scenarios</h4>
                <p>Every lesson started with real people (James, Rachel, Sarah, Tom & Lisa), real statistics, and real headlines. No abstract scenarios.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">✅ Personal & Emotional</h4>
                <p>Topics that actually matter to C1-C2 adult learners. Things you're already thinking about in your own life.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">✅ Honest Discussions</h4>
                <p>You talked about money, failure, toxic relationships, and uncomfortable truths. Real conversations adults need to have.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">✅ Speaking First</h4>
                <p>70%+ of each lesson was YOU speaking. Expressing your opinions, sharing your stories, reflecting on your life.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Continue Your Practice</h3>
